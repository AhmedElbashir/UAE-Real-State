The objective of this project was to build a predictive model to accurately estimate property prices in the UAE real estate market. Various regression models were evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting property prices based on multiple features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, building type, district, and city.
Based on the evaluation metrics, Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression emerged as the best models for predicting property prices in the UAE real estate market. Both models demonstrated high accuracy with R2 scores above 0.96 and significantly lower MSE values compared to Linear and Lasso Regression. The superior performance of these models suggests that they are better suited for capturing the complex relationships between property features and prices. Therefore, for future predictive modeling tasks in the real estate sector, we recommend prioritizing the use of ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for their robust predictive capabilities.
